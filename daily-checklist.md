## Day 1: Research (1 hour) ⏰
**Goal:** Choose style, find references, generate mockup

### Choose Style (20 min) ✅
- [x] Read Material Design guide thoroughly
- [x] Understand key characteristics (elevation, shadows, Roboto, 8dp grid)
- [x] Note authentic examples to reference
- **My style:** Material Design (Advanced ⭐⭐⭐)

### Find References (20 min) ⏰
**Task:** Find 10-15 authentic Material Design examples
- [ ] Google.com homepage
- [ ] Gmail interface  
- [ ] Google Drive
- [ ] Android OS screenshots
- [ ] Material Components demo sites
- [ ] Google Calendar
- [ ] Google Photos
- [ ] Medium articles using Material Design
- [ ] Airbnb (2015-2017 era)
- [ ] Trello interface
- [ ] Save screenshots to `/research/references/`
- [ ] Document sources and what makes each authentic

### Generate Mockup (20 min) ⏰
**Task:** Describe vision to AI and generate HTML mockup
- [ ] Use Initial Transformation prompt from research notes
- [ ] Focus on hero section first
- [ ] Screenshot result and save to `/screenshots/`
- [ ] Document initial AI collaboration notes

---

## Day 2: Context (1 hour) ⏰
**Goal:** AI creates 3 content pages about Material Design

### AI Creates Content Pages:
- [ ] **Timeline page** - History of Material Design (2014-present)
- [ ] **Designer profiles** - Matias Duarte, Nicholas Jitkoff, Rachel Been
- [ ] **About page** - Explanation of Material Design principles
- [ ] Review each page for accuracy against style guide
- [ ] Add authentic images (Google I/O, Android screenshots, etc.)

---

## Day 3: Planning (30 min) ⏰
**Goal:** Define 3 development sprints with success criteria

### Define 3 Sprints:
- [ ] **Sprint 1: Foundation** (2 hours)
  - Layout structure with 8dp grid
  - Roboto typography implementation  
  - Primary/secondary color palette
  - Basic elevation hierarchy
  - **Success criteria:** Structure matches references, typography isn't default fonts

- [ ] **Sprint 2: Components** (2 hours)
  - Navigation with proper elevation
  - Cards with correct shadows and radius
  - Floating Action Button (FAB)
  - Buttons with Material states
  - **Success criteria:** Components have proper elevation, mobile responsive

- [ ] **Sprint 3: Polish** (2 hours)
  - Complete all pages
  - Motion and transitions
  - Final responsive refinement
  - Lighthouse optimization
  - **Success criteria:** All pages done, Lighthouse 90+, works on mobile

## Days 4-6: Build (6 hours, 2hr/sprint) ⏰

### Sprint 1: Foundation (2 hours)
- [ ] Describe foundation needs to AI using prompts
- [ ] AI generates code with 8dp grid system
- [ ] Screenshot desktop/mobile versions
- [ ] Compare to Material Design references
- [ ] Iterate 2-3 times minimum
- [ ] Run Lighthouse performance check
- [ ] Document key decisions made
- [ ] Save screenshots with iteration notes

### Sprint 2: Components (2 hours)  
- [ ] Describe component needs to AI
- [ ] AI generates Material components (cards, FAB, nav, buttons)
- [ ] Screenshot desktop/mobile versions
- [ ] Compare to Material Design references
- [ ] Iterate 2-3 times minimum
- [ ] Test component interactions
- [ ] Run Lighthouse performance check
- [ ] Document key decisions made

### Sprint 3: Polish (2 hours)
- [ ] Complete remaining pages
- [ ] Add motion and transitions (Material easing curves)
- [ ] Final responsive refinement
- [ ] Screenshot desktop/tablet/mobile for all pages
- [ ] Compare to Material Design references
- [ ] Iterate 2-3 times minimum
- [ ] Final Lighthouse audit (target: all categories 90+)
- [ ] Test on actual mobile device
- [ ] Document final decisions

---

## Day 7: Reflection (1.5 hours) ⏰

### Collaboration Story (30 min)
- [ ] AI writes reflection on AI-human partnership
- [ ] Review and refine the collaboration narrative
- [ ] Add process screenshots showing iteration
- [ ] Document what worked well and what was challenging

### Final QA (30 min)
- [ ] Lighthouse 90+ all categories (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO)
- [ ] All pages responsive (desktop/tablet/mobile)
- [ ] All links and interactions work
- [ ] Check accessibility (keyboard navigation, color contrast)
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Material Design authenticity checklist completed

### Deploy & Submit (30 min)
- [ ] Deploy to hosting platform (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)
- [ ] Update README with final time log and live URL
- [ ] Final git commit with clean commit message
- [ ] Submit live URL + repository link to instructor

---

## Submission Checklist ✅
- [ ] Live site deployed and accessible
- [ ] Lighthouse scores 90+ in all categories  
- [ ] All pages responsive on desktop/tablet/mobile
- [ ] Collaboration story page complete
- [ ] README updated with time log and live URL
- [ ] `/research/` folder with references and notes
- [ ] GitHub repository link submitted to instructor
- [ ] Screenshots saved showing iteration process

---

## Daily Reminder 🎯
**Screenshot everything, compare to references, iterate 2-3x minimum.**

Every change should make the design more authentically Material Design, not just "working."
